When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would create a remote repository if I want to access the repository from different computers or share the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes you'll make commits, but they are not ready to be in Git's public repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is Git's version of clone; it creates a clone of another Git repository on GitHub.
Clones make a copy of a repository. You can clone a local repository or a remote repository.
Branches are labels for commits. You create branches to work on new features.
