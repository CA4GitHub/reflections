When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would create a remote repository if I want to access the repository from different computers or share the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes you'll make commits, but they are not ready to be in Git's public repository.
