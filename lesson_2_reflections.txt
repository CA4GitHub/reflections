What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository Git adds a hidden directory that contains info for the repository.  You need to do this because this is what creates the new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area knows which files in the working directory you want to commit.  Also, the staging area contains files with changes compared to their previous revision in the repository.  It allows users to commit some, but not all files in the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git add to add a file(s) from the working directory to the staging area.  Then use git diff --staged to compare files in staging area to those in the repository.  Also, git status will show you files in the staging area as well as files in the working directory that have been changed but not added to the staging area.
